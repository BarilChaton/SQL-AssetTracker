SQL AssetTracker.

This program is exactly the same as KWAB - Asset tracker only that this one uses Microsoft Entity Framework to store it's data. 
You have to setup a connection string as well as create a Database in SSMS.
Here is a link to download SSMS: https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/sql/ssms/download-sql-server-management-studio-ssms?view=sql-server-ver16
The connection string is located in: MyDbContext.cs file.

Thanks to Micorsoft Entity Framework you can see your assets even after closing the program and restarting it.

Other notifications:
As with KWAB - Asset tracker this program uses a userfriendly arrow controlled menu.
Select by pressing enter.

For images please see KWAB - Asset Tracker: https://github.com/BarilChaton/KWAB_AssetTracker
Everything looks just the same.
